//! The basic API to implement to provide an NFS file system
//!
//! Opaque FH
//! ---------
//! Files are only uniquely identified by a 64-bit file id. (basically an inode number)
//! We automatically produce internally the opaque filehandle which is comprised of
//!  - A 64-bit generation number derived from the server startup time (i.e. so the opaque file
//!    handle expires when the NFS server restarts)
//!  - The 64-bit file id
//!
//! readdir pagination
//! ------------------
//! We do not use cookie verifier. We just use the `start_after`.  The
//! implementation should allow startat to start at any position. That is,
//! the next query to readdir may be the last entry in the previous readdir
//! response.
//!
//! Other requirements
//! ------------------
//!  getattr needs to be fast. NFS uses that a lot
//!
//!  The 0 fileid is reserved and should not be used
